The Task 3 project focuses on predicting forest cover types using the UCI Covertype dataset. The dataset is fetched directly using the ucimlrepo library. Models used include Random Forest and XGBoost, with GridSearchCV applied for tuning.

Key outcomes:

Multi-class classification using real-world environmental data

Evaluation through confusion matrix and classification metrics

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization
